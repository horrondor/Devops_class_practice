1. ADD vs COPY

ADD and COPY are functionally similar. COPY supports basic copying of files into the container, from the build context or from a stage in a multi-stage build. ADD supports features for fetching files from remote HTTPS and Git URLs, and extracting tar files automatically when adding files from the build context.

    
2. CMD vs ENTRYPOINT

If there is multiple CMD instruction  on a dockerfile then the last one will 
take effect and it can also be  overriden at runtime. If an ENTRYPOINT is specified in dockerfile then CMD provides the default arguements for that ENTRYPOINT.

Unlike CMD ENTRYPOINT instruction cann't be overriden at runtime  and if an arguements are passed  at runtime then commands get appended rather than overridden.

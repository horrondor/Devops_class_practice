Topic : Explore and setup portainer.

	Overview of portainer architecture

        It is a universal container management tool. It works with Kubernetes, Docker, Docker Swarm and Azure ACI. It allows you to manage containers without needing to know platform-specific code

      Portainer consists of two elements: the Portainer Server and the Portainer Agent. Both run as lightweight containers on your existing containerized infrastructure. The Portainer Agent should be deployed to each node in your cluster and configured to report back to the Portainer Server container.
         
         A single Portainer Server will accept connections from any number of Portainer Agents, providing the ability to manage multiple clusters from one centralized interface. To do this, the Portainer Server container requires datapersistence. The Portainer Agents are stateless,with data being shipped back to the Portainer Server container.

	The Portainer server requires persistent storage in order to maintain the database and configuration information it needs to function

	About Edge agent 

	In standard deployments, the central Portainer Server instance and any environments it manages are assumed to be on the same network, that is Portainer srever and the Portainer Agents are able to seamlessly communicate with one another.	

	With edge agent rather than the portainer Server needing seamless access to the remote access to the remote environment, only the remote environment need to be able to access the portainer Server. This Communication is performed over an encrypted TLS tunnel. This is important in internet-connected configuration where there is no desire to expose the portainer Agent to the internet.


         Ports

	In order to access the UI and API, and for the Portainer Server instance and the Portainer Agents to communicate, certain ports need to be accessible.

 	On the Portainer Server the following ports must be open:

i) TCP port 9443 (or 30779 for Kubernetes with NodePort) for the UI and API
ii) TCP port 8000 (or 30776 for Kubernetes with NodePort) for the TCP tunnel server f  or Edge Agents. This port is optional and only required if using Edge Compute  fea  tures with Edge Agents.

      For the Portainer Agent:

 i) TCP port 9001 (or 30778 for Kubernetes with NodePort) must be accessible on the A   gent from the Portainer Server instance.

The Portainer Edge Agent does not require any open ports.

	Install portainer CE

#Install Portainer CE with Docker on Linux
	
Step1: Create the volume that Portainer Server will use to store its database:
       docker volume create portainer_data.

Step2: Then, download and install the Portainer Server container:

	 docker run -d \
         -p 8000:8000 \
         -p 9443:9443 \
         --name portainer \
         --restart=always \
         -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
         -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portain er-ce:lts

step3:  For Logging in	

        Now that the installation is complete, you can log into your Portainer Server instance by opening a web browser and going to:
 	https://localhost:9443

         Replace localhost with the relevant IP address or FQDN if needed, and adjust the port if you changed it earlier.

Step4:   After seeting up user in Portainer server
         Setup your environment to add a docker standalone environment run following command to run a portainer agent as aconatiner.
                
        docker run -d \
        -p 9001:9001 \
        --name portainer_agent \
        --restart=always \
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
        -v /var/lib/docker/volumes:/var/lib/docker/volumes \
        -v /:/host \
                portainer/agent:2.33.0 


step5: Now set a name as portainer_agent and environment as your ip address:9001 in Portainer Server Docker standalone environment setup.
